# Vertical-Farming
A final year project at MDX

This repository investigates a greenhouse farming system based on an ESP32 microcontroller. The
greenhouse monitoring and control system employs an ESP32 microcontroller as its central
node, interfaced with various sensors and actuators and integrated with a Raspberry Pi-based
graphical user interface (GUI). The viable and functional system demonstrates the capabilities
needed to create and upscale into a full-fledged system. A holistic and design-level thinking
approach is applied to dissect the architecture and identify bottlenecks and pathways to creating
a Greenhouse system. This enabled the implementation of targeted optimizations in the code,
enhancing the system's overall performance without introducing new hardware or protocols
and identifying things necessary for healthy plant growth. The paper thus serves as a
comprehensive guide for implementing efficient and reliable greenhouse control systems that
are scalable, robust, and suitable for modern agricultural needs.
